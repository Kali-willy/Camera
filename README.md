⚡ 3. GPU / Vulkan Rendering Boost

Sets Skia + Vulkan rendering engine (hwui.renderer skiavk) for smoother previews and real-time filters.

Enhances frame stability during camera preview and video capture.

Reduces lag and stutter in camera UIs and encoding processes.


🎞️ 4. Encoder & Decoder Prioritization

Gives media codecs higher priority, improving:

Video recording frame rate consistency.

Audio-video sync stability.

Overall encoding/decoding performance during playback and capture.
